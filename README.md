# My Theme

A modern Drupal 11 theme built with **Single Directory Components (SDC)** and powered by Webpack for efficient asset compilation.

## Overview

This theme is designed to work seamlessly with Drupal's **Single Directory Components** system, allowing you to build reusable, self-contained components with their own templates, styles, and JavaScript.

### Key Features

- ✅ **SDC Ready**: Fully compatible with Drupal's Single Directory Components
- 🎨 **SCSS Support**: Modern CSS preprocessing with Sass
- ⚡ **ES6+ JavaScript**: Modern JavaScript with Babel transpilation
- 🔍 **Code Quality**: Integrated ESLint and Stylelint with real-time file watching
- 🎯 **SVG Sprite Generation**: Automatic SVG sprite compilation for icons
- 📊 **Build Stats**: Detailed build performance metrics with WebpackBar
- 🔄 **Watch Mode**: Live compilation and linting during development

## Single Directory Components (SDC)

Each component follows the SDC pattern with this structure:

```
components/[type]/[component-name]/
├── [component-name].component.yml  # Component definition
├── [component-name].twig           # Twig template
├── src/
│   ├── [component-name].js        # Component JavaScript
│   └── [component-name].scss      # Component styles
└── [component-name].js            # Compiled JavaScript (auto-generated)
└── [component-name].css           # Compiled CSS (auto-generated)
```

### Example Component Structure

```
components/molecules/button/
├── button.component.yml
├── button.twig
├── src/
│   ├── button.js
│   └── button.scss
├── button.js     # ← Generated by Webpack
└── button.css    # ← Generated by Webpack
```

## What Webpack Does

Webpack handles all asset compilation and optimization for this theme:

### JavaScript Processing
- **Transpilation**: Converts modern ES6+ JavaScript to browser-compatible ES5
- **Polyfills**: Automatically includes necessary polyfills via `core-js`
- **Code Quality**: Runs ESLint to catch errors and enforce code standards (fails build on errors)
- **Source Maps**: Generates inline source maps in development mode for debugging

### SCSS/CSS Processing
- **Compilation**: Converts SCSS to standard CSS
- **Auto-prefixing**: Adds vendor prefixes for browser compatibility
- **Extraction**: Separates CSS into individual files matching component structure
- **Linting**: Validates SCSS code with Stylelint (fails build on errors)

### SVG Sprite Generation
- **Auto-Discovery**: Finds all SVG files in `images/icons/`
- **Sprite Creation**: Combines them into a single `icons-sprite.svg` file
- **Symbol IDs**: Prefixes each icon with `icon-` (e.g., `icon-home`)
- **Watch Support**: Automatically rebuilds sprite when existing SVG files are modified
- **No JS Output**: Generates only the SVG sprite (no unnecessary JavaScript)

### File Organization
- **Dynamic Entry Points**: Automatically discovers all `.js` and `.scss` files in `components/**/src/`
- **Folder Structure**: Maintains the same directory structure in output
- **Clean Output**: Only generates necessary files (no build artifacts in version control)

## NPM Commands

### Development

```bash
npm start
```

**What it does:**
- Runs **three parallel watchers**:
  - **webpack**: Compiles assets in watch mode with automatic recompilation
  - **eslint**: Watches JavaScript files and shows lint errors in real-time
  - **stylelint**: Watches SCSS files and shows lint errors in real-time
- Generates **inline source maps** for easier debugging
- Outputs unminified code for development
- Shows lint errors immediately when you save files

**Important Notes:**
- Modifying existing SVG icons will trigger automatic sprite rebuild
- Adding **new** SVG files requires restarting `npm start`
- Lint errors are shown but won't stop the watch process

**Use this when:** You're actively developing and want instant feedback on changes.

---

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

**What it does:**
1. **Runs all linters FIRST** - ESLint and Stylelint validate all code
2. **Stops immediately if lint errors found** - Won't compile assets with bad code
3. Runs Webpack in **production mode** only after linting passes
4. **Minifies** JavaScript and CSS for optimal file size
5. Shows **build statistics** and performance metrics
6. Generates optimized assets for deployment
7. No source maps (smaller file sizes)

**Use this when:** You're ready to deploy or want to test production-optimized code.

**Output includes:**
- ✔ Lint results for JavaScript and SCSS
- ✔ Compilation status for each build stage
- 📊 Profile statistics (build time by file type and loader)
- ⚠️ Build fails on any lint errors (exit code 1 or 2)

---

### Linting Commands

```bash
# Run all linters
npm run lint

# Lint JavaScript only
npm run lint:js

# Lint SCSS only
npm run lint:scss
```

**Use these when:** You want to check code quality without building assets.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development

```bash
npm start
```

This will watch for changes and automatically recompile your assets.

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This creates optimized, production-ready assets.

## Using SVG Icons

Place your SVG files in `images/icons/` and they'll be automatically compiled into a sprite:

### Adding an Icon

1. Add your SVG file: `images/icons/my-icon.svg`
2. **Restart** `npm start` if it's running (new files aren't detected in watch mode)
3. Build will generate: `images/icons-sprite.svg`
4. Use in templates:

```twig
<svg class="icon">
  <use xlink:href="{{ base_path ~ directory }}/images/icons-sprite.svg#icon-my-icon"></use>
</svg>
```

### Modifying Existing Icons

- Changes to existing SVG files are detected automatically in watch mode
- The sprite rebuilds immediately when you save changes
- No need to restart the watch process

---

## Code Quality Tools

### ESLint (JavaScript)
- **Config**: `eslint.config.js`
- **Rules**: Based on recommended standards + Prettier integration
- Runs automatically during `npm start` (watch mode) and `npm run build:prod`
- **Development**: Shows warnings and errors in terminal as you code
- **Production**: Fails build if any errors are found
- Reports warnings for issues like unused variables

### Stylelint (SCSS/CSS)
- **Config**: `.stylelintrc.json`
- **Rules**: Based on `stylelint-config-standard`
- Validates hex colors, duplicate properties, unknown units
- Runs automatically during `npm start` (watch mode) and `npm run build:prod`
- **Development**: Shows errors in terminal as you code
- **Production**: Fails build if any errors are found
- Enforces consistent formatting

### Prettier (Code Formatting)
- Integrated with ESLint for consistent formatting
- Ensures code style consistency across the project
- Auto-fixable issues reported by ESLint

### How Linting Works

**Development Mode (`npm start`):**
- Three parallel watchers run continuously
- Lint errors appear immediately in terminal when you save
- Build continues even with lint errors (for faster iteration)
- You see issues but can keep working

**Production Mode (`npm run build:prod`):**
- Linters run BEFORE webpack compilation
- Any lint error stops the entire build process
- Assets are NOT generated if code has errors
- Ensures only clean code gets deployed

---

## Browser Support

JavaScript targets modern browsers via Babel:
- `> 0.25%` market share
- Not dead browsers
- Automatic polyfills for required features

---

## Development Tips

### Component Best Practices

1. **Keep components atomic**: Each component should do one thing well
2. **Use the SDC structure**: Follow the component.yml → twig → src pattern
3. **Scope your styles**: Use BEM or component-scoped class names
4. **Document props**: Define all component properties in `*.component.yml`

### Watching for Issues

- Monitor the terminal output during `npm start`
- ESLint and Stylelint errors appear immediately when you save
- Watch for the file path and line number in error messages
- Fix issues as they appear for the smoothest development experience

### Performance

- Use `npm run build:prod` to see build stats
- Check "Stats by Loader" to identify slow compilation steps
- Large SCSS files? Consider splitting them into partials

### Adding New SVG Icons

- New SVG files in `images/icons/` require restarting `npm start`
- Webpack's watch mode doesn't detect new files matching glob patterns
- Modifications to existing SVGs are detected automatically

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Check terminal output for specific errors
2. Run linters manually: `npm run lint` to see all issues
3. Verify file syntax (especially SCSS/JS)
4. Fix reported errors - production builds won't proceed with lint errors

### Changes Not Appearing
1. Ensure `npm start` is running
2. Check you're editing files in `src/` folders
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5)
4. Clear Drupal cache: `drush cr`

### Icons Not Showing
1. Verify SVG is in `images/icons/`
2. If you added a new SVG, restart `npm start`
3. Check `images/icons-sprite.svg` was generated
4. Confirm the symbol ID matches your filename (prefixed with `icon-`)
